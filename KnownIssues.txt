1. Exception Handling missing in Roll number input form. If non integer entered into Roll Number, 
   data is not entered into database , so during login it shows invalid email.
   (Error is displayed in terminal)

2. If integer entered into name,integer is accepted as name(Error handling missing but works fine)
